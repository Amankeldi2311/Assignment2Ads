## Overview:
This project aims to provide custom implementations of various data structures commonly used in programming. 
It includes implementations of array list, linked lists, min heaps, queues, and stacks, along with supporting iterator classes for iteration through the data structures(LinkedList and ArrayList).

# MyArrayList
Implements a dynamic array, providing methods for adding, removing, and accessing elements.

## Classes and Interfaces:

MyArrayList: 
Implements a dynamic array, providing methods for adding, removing, and accessing elements.
MyLinkedList:Implements a linked list, offering methods for insertion, deletion, and traversal
## MyMinHeap:
The MyMinHeap class implements a generic minimum heap data structure using a custom list implementation provided by the MyList interface. 
It allows for efficient management of data in a way that ensures the minimum element is readily accessible.
## MyQueue:
The MyQueue class provides a custom implementation of a queue data structure using a provided list implementation through the MyList interface. 
It follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle, where elements are added at the end and removed from the front.
## MyStack:
Represents a stack data structure, based on MyLinkedList.
## MyList:
Interface defining common methods for both MyArrayList and MyLinkedList.
## Class Main:
Contains methods for testing the functionality of the implemented data structures and performing input-output operations.
